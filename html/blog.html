        <p class="blogContent">
            Communication makes humans different from any other species on earth. We can share our thoughts and ideas
            more efficiently than any other organism. Earlier it was very costly to talk to someone next to our city but
            today it has become very cheap even across the world. All of this is possible due to the immense growth of
            technology.
        </p>
        <p class="blogContent">
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">What is technology?</h2>
        <p class="blogContent">
            Technology is a powerful tool which applies scientific knowledge to practical aims of human life to improve
            productivity, creativity and convenience. The world is so immersed in it that it’s hard to believe that even
            20 years ago things were extremely different. It is sometimes referred to, the alteration and manipulation
            of the human environment. Our ability to apply scientific knowledge is made possible by technology. It
            encompasses not only devices, such as computers, but also methods and procedures, such as the method by
            which computer chips are manufactured. The goal of information technology is to facilitate tasks.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">Uses of technology in daily life</h2>
        <p class="blogContent">
            It’s quite fascinating how technology has changed our daily lives. We use technology every passing day by
            one means or another. What blows my mind is how technology has evolved with the changing time and needs. Not
            long ago, we used diaries for our assignments. Platforms such as Google Classroom and My Second Teacher are
            modern diaries which have helped save us paper, environment and our time. Similarly, technology has made it
            easier to farm, more feasible to build cities, and more convenient to travel, among many other things,
            effectively helping to create globalisation, and making it easier for economies to grow and for companies to
            do business.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Positive Impacts Of Technology</h2>
        <p class="blogContent">
            The world of technology is ever-evolving, and many fields have been completely transformed by technological
            breakthroughs and advancements. Let’s have a look at the positive impacts technology has made in our
            society.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">1. Easy communication</h3>
        <p class="blogContent">
            Who hasn’t heard of facebook, instagram or twitter? They have become our primary source of communication
            today. With a click of a button, you can make calls, send emails and do a lot of things with the help of
            technology. Now you don’t need to write letters to your loved ones if you are missing them. Do a video call
            and feel them close to you. In addition to social media platforms, there are numerous other applications
            specifically designed for communication. If social media isn’t for you, WhatsApp and other messaging apps
            enable you to quickly message family and friends and even make calls over Wi-Fi. While the 2020 pandemic had
            kept everyone socially apart, technology allowed families, friends and relatives to connect virtually.
            Nepal’s family is one of many who celebrated Dashain Tika online during the lockdown.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subHeading">2. Advanced health care</h3>
        <p class="blogContent">
            Many technological advances have eased patient care, as well as patient comfort.Patients now have access to
            prosthetics,
            implants, hearing aids, dental devices whereas earlier, these types of accommodations used to be expensive
            and difficult
            to make. Furthermore, the collection of an extremely large pool of information related to health and
            medicine can further
            the accuracy of analytical research, predict health trends and major epidemics, and ultimately speed up the
            search for
            disease prevention and eradication.
            <br>
            Another big perk of health care advancements in technology is the ability to store and transmit health care
            records
            easily and efficiently. Gone are the days of bulky paper files that have to be faxed to other medical
            providers.This
            shift to digital records not only streamlines the documentation process itself, but reduces costs and
            improves
            patient-doctor relationships, as patients get easy access to their health records via an online interface.
            There are also
            personalised applications available to help patients improve anxiety and stress, monitor sleep, get therapy
            without having
            to go to a physical location, monitor and track their diet and exercise, and more.
            <br>
            New technologies such as virtual visits, chatbots were being extensively used to deliver healthcare to
            individuals,
            especially during Covid-19.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subHeading">3. Industrialization of agriculture</h3>
        <p class="blogContent">
            Agricultural societies were previously based on the cycle of the seasons.Agriculture workers laboured six
            days a week,
            from sunup to sun down, just to keep their crops growing. Although conditions like these still exist, the
            industrialization of agriculture radically transformed due to technological advancements.The innovation of
            machinery
            such as combined harvesters and planters simplifies the task and reduces the cost of labour.
            <br>
            The farmers cannot determine the sowing period, but with the aid of Artificial Intelligence farmers can know
            the weather
            changes by the use of weather forecasts.
            <br>
            Satellites, drones and aerial imaging are becoming advanced in taking the farm high quality images. This
            equipment’s aid
            the farmers to analyse the crops while they are at the comfort of their home as if they are actually in the
            farm. They
            access the crops' status from a distance. The drones can also be used to spray pesticides on the crops.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subHeading">4. Educational achievements</h3>
        <p class="blogContent">
            Google search, online courses and youtube videos have allowed people to have faster access to
            education.Technology has a positive impact on learning. Technology provides hands-on learning opportunities
            to integrate into all school curriculum areas including Mathematics, Reading, Science and Social Studies,
            and other departments. <br>
            It provides an opportunity to collaborate with peers and learn from each other. The rapid development of
            technology is changing the way students and teachers think. So with advanced and fast growing technology
            they
            get very creative.
            The accessibility of technology has made it easier for us to experience so many things, making us even more
            productive and
            creative. One of the most significant benefits of technology in education is that it has made information
            more accessible to
            all. <br>
            Not only does it facilitate access to information, it also facilitates access to updated information.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Negative Impacts Of Technology</h2>
        <p class="blogContent">
            Technology always comes with two things: promise and unintended consequences. Technology is equally capable
            of making lives
            easier and happier.
            <br>
            The reduction of fossil energies, the need for further rare- earth rudiments, the use of rare rudiments
            similar as gold,
            coltan and tantalum( as is needed for ultramodern electronics) which have frequently helped energy wars in
            mineral rich
            mainlands and countries and the burning of energies potentially impacting Global Warming are all veritably
            real issues
            created by an adding use of technology.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subHeading">1. Depletion Of Resources</h3>
        <p class="blogContent">
            One of the most disquieting issues associated with the adding use of
            technologies is the
            reduction of natural resources,whether that be rare earth rudiments minerals, food sources, or fossil
            energies. As noted by
            Karehka Ramey( 2012), the use of sludge to produce energy in the form of ethanol, for case, can greatly
            reduce sludge/ food
            inventories encyclopedically. also, the world’s hunger for further and further electronics can greatly or
            fully deplete the
            world’s resources of gold, coltan, and other rare minerals, while helping to fuel conflicts around the world
            where those
            “ blood minerals ” are set up and frequently fought over.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subHeading">2. Health concerns</h3>
        <p class="blogContent">
            Despite the invention of contraceptives, the mortal global population has
            exploded, in part
            due to better technologies that have allowed for longer life spans, more abundant food vacuity, and the
            operation of
            resources that have allowed for further effective reduplication. Ironically, the presence of further humans
            is incompletely
            related to resources being more depleted, but also performing in further effective operation being enforced.
            still, the
            adding operation of technology has affected some health pandemics that preliminarily were unheard of,
            including the
            development of societal sedentary cultures( similar as constant sitting), inordinate exposure to blue light
            from electronic
            bias, and constant exposure to EMFs, which can affect in habitual illness similar as vulnerable system
            dysfunction.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subHeading">3. Pollution Increase</h3>
        <p class="blogContent">
            Along with the reduction of resources,one of the most notable negative impacts
            of technology is
            the great increase in pollution due to industrialization. This includes fossil energy emigrations, global
            warming, and
            metropolises around the world whose manufactories emit massive amounts of solid and air pollution/ waste,
            performing in
            large increases in cancer and habitual illness incidents. And while climate change is a largely
            controversial subject,
            numerous scientists agree that global warming is veritably real and is a trouble to the mortal species.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subHeading">4. Technological unemployment</h3>
        <p class="blogContent">
            Technological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change.
            It is a key type
            of structural unemployment.Technology unemployment has both beneficial and harmful implications. On the one
            hand, technology
            can boost employee productivity and give employees access to new opportunities. On the other side, as
            machines or robots take
            over duties that were previously performed by people, technology can also result in the displacement of
            workers. A decline in
            earnings and employment may result from this.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Tech in Bonsai Business</h2>
        <p class="blogContent">
            Growing and training miniature trees in containers is called bonsai, a traditional Japanese art form that
            was originated from penjing, a traditional Chinese art form. These plant
            aren't found everywhere. Because of technology, shopping these plants has become easier. <br>
            Technology has a big impact while selling these plants because people who are interested in bonsai plants
            can sit at the comfort of their home and look for bonsai plants through internet along with their prices.
            They dont need to go from places to places looking for the plants. And everyone can choose from the
            variaties of plants they want without going anywhere.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subHeading">1. Better Information Access</h3>
        <p class="blogContent">
            These days, purchasing something is only a few clicks away. For
            many of us, we can simply pull out our phones, start Googling, or even ask our smart home assistant to do it
            for us. We can now google the prices of bonsai and even compare them to other prices. There are now
            thousands of sites dedicated to bonsai plants including our website, Bonsai Palace,
            thanks to technological advancements.
        </p>


        <h3 class="subHeading">2. Accessible Shopping</h3>
        <p class="blogContent">
            As mentioned, technology has made shopping convenient and popular . People can stay at their
            comfort at their home and
            shop for plants anytime and choose whichever they want with just thier fingers. With the vast majority of us
            owning a tablet,
            laptop or smartphone, we’ve all got easy access to a virtual shop right in front of us, where we can
            buy pretty much anything
            we want.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Overall Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="blogContent">
            Technology has its own pros and cons. At the end of the day, it depends upon us to utilize it in a proper
            way. Since, yechnology is vital in our lives, we should learn how to control the use technology rather than
            allowing it to control us.
